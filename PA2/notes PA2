inplay bracket - keeps track of who is in play, corresponds to a boolean with same index

readfile()
team names to be read into allteams and all probs

shuffle()
shuffles names and probabilities of allteams
then copies into bracket 1 names
copies probs into bracket 1 probs
these 2 will be used to play round 1
allteams will correspond to the boolean inplay

PROBLEM: after first round, how do you switch the booleans for inplay based on indexes from bracket 2?

bracket ()
using bracket 1,2,3
pointers to those bracket positions

play function - can specify which team to pass in? change every time? 
currentHome, currentAway --> non specific to a bracket, pointers whose address should be changed after each time you call play() in main

do this 4 times (4 quarters)
output which quarter this is, increase quarter count
draw random int
compare to TD:
	if less than, they score
	increase score
	else,
	draw random int
	if less than, they score
	increase score
	else,
	no score

draw random int:
compare to TD other team
	if less than,
	they score
	increase score
	else,
	draw random int
	if less than, they score,
	increase score
	else,
	no score

comparing scores: 
if team 1 wins,
	cout team 1 wins, boolean team 2 true
if team 2 wins, 
	cout team 2 wins, boolean team 1 true
else same score
while same score,
	draw random int
	compare to TD:
		if less than, they score
		increase score
		else,
		draw random int
		if less than, they score
		increase score
		else,
		no score

	draw random int:
	compare to TD other team
		if less than,
		they score
		increase score
		else,
		draw random int
		if less than, they score,
		increase score
		else,
		no score

	recompare scores:
	if team 1 wins,
	cout team 1 wins, boolean team 2 true
	quit while loop
	if team 2 wins, 
	cout team 2 wins, boolean team 1 true
	quit while loop

STATS (touchdown):
display team names
touchdowns per team per round (attempted and successful)
total touchdowns per team
total touchdowns/touchdowns attempted (decimal of previous column)
team's corresponding probBracket1[0][i]
probBracket1[0][i]-decimal

STATS(fieldgoal):
same thing but using FG counters
