Notes PA3
dynamically allocate rooms array, figure out how many lines are in first part of input txt. variable called room count
that is implemented in file

Room* rooms;

	figure out # of rooms
	

rooms = new Room[linesIndex];
for(int i=0; i < linesIndex; i++)
{
	stringstream ss;
	ss << lines[i];
	ss >> rooms[i].building_code
	>> rooms[i].room_number
	>> rooms[i].max_students;
}
//Fill array

How to know a line is blank? 
int linesIndex=0;
string line;
string lines[100]; -->can reuse this 
ifile.getline(line);

if(fail state)

if line.size() == 1, it's a blank line

line.size() --> tells you how many char in string variable, does not iinclude newline chaacter

For -- comments:

if(line.find("--")) != 0 -->returns where the characters start, if statement says "if not a comment...do xyz"
//Keep this line, store it somewhere, etc
lines[linesIndex]=line;
linesIndex++;

How does Crowley's code work?

The function you call is bool schedule sections.
it returns true or false.
If true, the rooms were scheduled. If false, the rooms were unable to be scheduled.
